## What I Build

- **Agentic systems** with explicit planning, execution, and verification loops
- **Document intelligence pipelines** (OCR, VLMs, tables, handwriting → structured data)
- **Full-stack GenAI products** (Next.js + Python services)
- **Production inference systems** (containerized, batch-aware, observable)
